hipages Full Stack Engineer Tech Challenge
==========================================
## Getting Started
From the root of the project, run `docker-compose up -d`
* You should now have the UI running at http://localhost:3000 and the server running at http://localhost:5000
* You should now have a MySQL database running at localhost:3306
    * The username is `root`
    * The password is `hipages`

If at any point you want to refresh the database, you can stop the Docker containers (`docker-compose down`) and start them again
